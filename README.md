The Common Chicken Runtime Engine
=================================

The CCRE solves the problem of writing elegant and maintainable robot software
by using a dataflow model and taking care of the infrastructure for your
project so that you can focus on the important parts of your code.

Here's an example of a robot piloted with Tank Drive:

    Drive.arcade(FRC.joystick1,
                 FRC.talon(1, FRC.MOTOR_FORWARD),
                 FRC.talon(2, FRC.MOTOR_REVERSE));

Or, something more interesting: an example of a shifting drive train:

    BooleanOutput shifter = FRC.solenoid(2);
    shifter.setFalseWhen(FRC.startTele);
    shifter.setTrueWhen(FRC.joystick1.onPress(3));
    shifter.setFalseWhen(FRC.joystick1.onPress(1));

The project is licensed under the LGPL, which means that you can freely use it
as a dependency of your project without affecting the license that you use for
your project. This is approximate: you should review the terms of the license,
which can be found in COPYING and COPYING.LESSER.

Since this project is publicly available, you can use it for FRC robot software
legally under the rules (as of 2015), as long as, if you make any changes
before Kickoff, you make your changes available publicly. That's because of the
FRC rules, not the license. The license does mean that if you release changes
to this framework itself publicly, you pretty much have to also make those
changes available under the LGPL.
